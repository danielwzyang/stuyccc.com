title: PClassic 2024 Fall
---
Along with the problem statements linked below, PClassic also provided us with code stubs to get past the painful IO process in java and python. You can find the stubs <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/28crpiqnd60qbzk/stubs.zip?dl=0&file_subpath=%2FSTUBS">here</a>. Note that the solution codes below will not include the stubs (ie the input process) and instead only include the functions we wrote to solve the problem.
