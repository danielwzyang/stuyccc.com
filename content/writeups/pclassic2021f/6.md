    int s = grid[i][j] + grid[i][j+1] + grid[i][j+2];
    for (int ii = 0; ii < 3; ii++) {
        if (grid[i+ii][j] + grid[i+ii][j+1] + grid[i+ii][j+2] != s)
            return false;

public static boolean magicSquare(int[][] grid) {
    int n = grid.length;
    int m = grid[0].length;
    for(int i = 0; i < n-2; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m-2; j++) {
            // System.out.println(i + " " + j);
            if (ism(grid, i, j)) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}</java>

The ism function determines whether or not a magic square with a top left corner of i,j exists. It does this by find the sum of the first row, and then looping through the rest of the rows, the columns, and the two diagonals to check if the sum of those are the same as the sum of the first row. If there exists one that isn't the same the square isn't a magic square, else it is a magic square. The code then loops through all valid top left positions in the graph and checks if there is at least one magic square.
