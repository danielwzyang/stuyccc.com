<java>// written by Maxwell Zen
public static String decode(String s, int k) {
    k %= 26;
    if (k < 0) k += 26;
    String ans = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        char c = s.charAt(i);
        c -= k;
        if (c < 'a') c += 26;
        ans += c;
    }
    return ans;
}</java>

The first operation we must do is make sure k is a number between 0 and 25. We can use the mod operation to ensure k is a number between -25 and 25, then we can add 26 if k is negative to achieve our result. Then, for each character in the string, we can subtract k from the character. In order to account for overflow, we can add 26 to the character if it is no longer a letter of the alphabet.
