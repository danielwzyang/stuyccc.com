    int n = s.length();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        char c = (char)(s.charAt(i) - 'a');
        if (matching[c] == 0) {
            matching[c] = t.charAt(i);
        } else if (matching[c] != t.charAt(i)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (matching[i] != 0) {
            for (int j = i+1; j < 26; j++) {
                if (matching[i]==matching[j]) return false;

We create an array to record the character that corresponds to each letter in s. As we loop through the string, if we encounter a letter for the first time, the set the matching for that letter. Else, if we've already encountered that character and it has been matched with something different, we return false. At the end, we need to make sure that no two characters in s have been matched with the same character in t, so we loop through every pair of characters to make sure that they are different.
