The number of unbeatable peacocks is the number of all peacocks which can't be beat. Therefore we can loop through all pairs of peacocks and check if any one peacock in the pair beats the other. We keep a beat array such that beat[i] = boolean representing if peacock i was beat. When a peacock in the pair is beat, we set beat[i] = true. We then count the amount of trues in beat and subtract that from the total number of peacocks.
