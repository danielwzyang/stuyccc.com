<java>// written by Maxwell Zen
public static String reversedMessage(String message, int k) {
    int n = message.length();
    StringBuilder a;
    a = new StringBuilder(message.substring(n-k, n));
    a.reverse();
    String ans = message.substring(0, n-k) + a.toString();
    return ans;
}</java>

It would be nice if Java Strings had a reverse operation - unfortunately, they don't. Luckily, the StringBuilder class offers this functionality. We can create a StringBuilder instance using the substring we want to reverse, then call the reverse() method, then convert it back into a String to add to the non-reversed section of the message.
