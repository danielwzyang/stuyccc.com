Part 1
<python># written by Mohammad Khan
fin = open("../Input.in", "r");
fout = open("../Part1.out", "w");

def main():
    lines = [line.strip().split() for line in fin.read().split("\n")[0:-1]];
    fout.write(str(solve(lines)));

def solve(lines):
    x,y = 0,0;
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        if (lines[i][0] == "forward"): x += int(lines[i][1]);
        if (lines[i][0] == "down"): y += int(lines[i][1]);
        if (lines[i][0] == "up"): y -= int(lines[i][1]);
    return x*y;

main();</python>

Notice that when you are comparing two sets of three in for example the list [a,b,c,d] if we compare a+b+c and b+c+d we really are only comparing between a and d. So for this part we can just loop through the list and if i >= 3 and list[i] > list[i-3] increment the count, and at the end print the count.

Part 2
<python># written by Mohammad Khan
fin = open("../Input.in", "r");
fout = open("../Part2.out", "w");

def main():
    lines = [line.strip().split() for line in fin.read().split("\n")[0:-1]];
    fout.write(str(solve(lines)));

def solve(lines):
    x,y,a = 0,0,0;
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        if (lines[i][0] == "forward"):
            x += int(lines[i][1]);
            y += a * int(lines[i][1]);
        if (lines[i][0] == "down"): a += int(lines[i][1]);
        if (lines[i][0] == "up"): a -= int(lines[i][1]);
    return x*y;

main();</python>

The instructions for this problem is fairly simple, First read in the lines from the input file. Then initialize x and y to 0. Then for each line in the lines read, split them by the space and then if 1st part is "forward" increase x by the 2nd part, if 1st part is "down" increase y by the 2nd part, and if 1st part is "up" decrease y by the 2nd part. Finally at the end print x*y.
