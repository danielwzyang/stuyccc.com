Part 1
<python># Written by Mohammad Khan
fin = open("../Input.in", "r");
fout = open("../Part1.out", "w");

def main():
    lines = [line.strip() for line in fin.read().split("\n")[0:-1]];
    lines = [int(x) for x in lines[0].split(",")];
    fout.write(str(solve(lines)));

def solve(lines):
    lines.sort();
    med = lines[len(lines)/2];
    ans = 0;
    for x in lines:
        ans += abs(x-med);
    return ans;

main();</python>

The ideal method of reducing cost for part 1 is to choose the median number as our aligning position and then move everyone to this median number. Notice that if the list has an even number of elements we can use either one of the median numbers. We can get the median number by sorting the list and then list[size/2] is the median number. So for each element in the list find the difference in their position from the median number, and sum up all those differences and then return the sum.

The proof to this being the optimal minimization has to do with the following somewhat intuitive idea. If you already chose a position x to be your meeting point, if you increase x by 1, all the distances of points below x increase by 1 and all distances above x decrease by 1.

Part 2
<python># Written by Mohammad Khan
fin = open("../Input.in", "r");
fout = open("../Part2.out", "w");

def main():
    lines = [line.strip() for line in fin.read().split("\n")[0:-1]];
    lines = [int(x) for x in lines[0].split(",")];
    fout.write(str(solve(lines)));

def solve(lines):
    avg = 0.0;
    for x in lines: avg += x;
    avg /= len(lines);
    below = int(avg);
    above = int(avg+1);
    cost1 = 0;
    cost2 = 0;
    for x in lines:
        cost1 += abs(x-below)*(abs(x-below)+1)/2;
        cost2 += abs(x-above)*(abs(x-above)+1)/2;
    return min(cost1,cost2);

main();</python>

The ideal method of reducing cost for part 2 is the choose (somewhere near) the average number as our aligning position. Within +- .5 of the average according to some smart people on reddit. Also notice that when calculating the cost we have to do dif*(dif+1)/2 as our cost instead of just dif. Return the minimum of the two sums and that is our final answer.

The proof to this minimizing dif*(dif+1)/2 cost gets its basis around the problem of solving a similar minimizing dif^2 cost, which we already know the answer to be the average.
