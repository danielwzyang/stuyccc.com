Part 1
<cpp>// Written by Maxwell Zen
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int cnt[1000][1000];

// return direction a must go to meet b
int dir(int a, int b) {
    if (a < b) return 1;
    else if (a==b) return 0;
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin ("input.txt");
    string s;
    // read each line into a string s;
    while ( getline (fin, s) ) {
        int x, y, x2, y2;
        // scan coordinates from string
        sscanf(s.c_str(), "%d,%d -> %d,%d", &x, &y, &x2, &y2);
        int dx = dir(x, x2), dy = dir(y, y2);
        while (true) {
            // increment only if line is horizontal or vertical
            if (dx==0 || dy==0) cnt[x][y]++;
            // break if we've reached endpoint
            if (x==x2 && y==y2) break;
            // step forward
            x += dx; y += dy;
        }
    }
    int ans = 0;
    // count points counted more than once
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 1000; j++) {
            if (cnt[i][j]>1) ans++;
        }
    }
    // output answer
    cout << ans << endl;
}</cpp>

First create a 2d array of ints called cnt to store how many times a point is marked by a line. We'll start with x and y at the initial coordinates of the line, and set dx and dy to the direction x and y must move in (1, 0, or -1). To calculate dx and dy, we write a function dir that returns 1, 0, or -1, depending on which direction the first argument must move in to meet the second argument. Then in a while loop, we increment cnt if the line is horizontal or vertical (dx is 0 or dy is 0). If we've reached the endpoint, we break out of the whiel loop, otherwise we keep going. Finally, we go through each point to count how many have been incremented more than once.

Part 2
<cpp>// Written by Maxwell Zen
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int cnt[1000][1000];

// return direction a must go to meet b
int dir(int a, int b) {
    if (a < b) return 1;
    else if (a==b) return 0;
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    ifstream fin ("input.txt");
    string s;
    // read each line into a string s;
    while ( getline (fin, s) ) {
        int x, y, x2, y2;
        // scan coordinates from string
        sscanf(s.c_str(), "%d,%d -> %d,%d", &x, &y, &x2, &y2);
        int dx = dir(x, x2), dy = dir(y, y2);
        while (true) {
            // increment count
            cnt[x][y]++;
            // break if we've reached endpoint
            if (x==x2 && y==y2) break;
            // step forward
            x += dx; y += dy;
        }
    }
    int ans = 0;
    // count points counted more than once
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 1000; j++) {
            if (cnt[i][j]>1) ans++;
        }
    }
    // output answer
    cout << ans << endl;
}</cpp>

We are going to use the same helper functions as described in part 1, but our algorithm changes a bit. First initialize a set called "bad" which represents all the completed boards. We are first looping through the list of numbers given in order, and then loop through the boards like in part 1. Also add to the boards we loop through as well and check them, however this time if the check turns out to be true instead of ending the function we are going to add the index value of the board into the bad set. We are going to continue this process until the bad set reaches the same size as the number of boards given. Notice that the set is used to prevent overcounting of bad sets. Now when we see that the bad set is equal in size to the number of boards that means the board that just added to the bad set is the last board, so we can return the sum of this board times the current number.
