Part 1
<python># written by Mohammad Khan
fin = open("../Input.in", "r");
fout = open("../Part1.out", "w");

def main():
    lines = [int(line.strip()) for line in fin.read().split("\n")[0:-1]];
    fout.write(str(solve(lines)));

def solve(lines):
    cnt = 0;
    for i in range(1, len(lines)):
        if (lines[i] > lines[i-1]):
            cnt += 1;
    return cnt;

main();</python>

Well this first problem doesn't really need much explanation, just figure out how to read input from a file for your respective language. And then loop through the list you have gotten and if i != 0 and list[i] < list[i-1] increment the count. And at the end print the count.

Part 2
<python># written by Mohammad Khan
fin = open("../Input.in", "r");
fout = open("../Part2.out", "w");

def main():
    lines = [int(line.strip()) for line in fin.read().split("\n")[0:-1]];
    fout.write(str(solve(lines)));

def solve(lines):
    cnt = 0;
    for i in range (3, len(lines)):
        if (lines[i] > lines[i-3]):
            cnt += 1;
    return cnt;

main();</python>

Notice that when you are comparing two sets of three in for example the list [a,b,c,d] if we compare a+b+c and b+c+d we really are only comparing between a and d. So for this part we can just loop through the list and if i >= 3 and list[i] > list[i-3] increment the count, and at the end print the count.
