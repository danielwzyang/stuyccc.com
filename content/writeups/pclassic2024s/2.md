<cpp>// written by Chongtian Ma 
#include &lt;iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int a, b, c; cin >> a >> b >> c;
	if((a * b) - c == 0 || (a * c) - b == 0 || (b * c) - a == 0 ||
	   a * (b - c) == 0 || a * (c - b) == 0 || b * (c - a) == 0 || (a - b) * c == 0){
		cout << "YES" << endl;
	}
	else{
		cout << "NO" << endl;
	}
}</cpp>

There are several approaches to this problem. You could either list out all the possible cases and orderings like I did, or use std::next_permutation to iterate through all permutations of an array with elements {a, b, c}, and take the maximum of the expressions over all permutations.
