<cpp>// written by Chongtian Ma 
#include &lt;iostream>
#include &lt;string>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	string s; int k; cin >> s >> k;
	cout << s[(k - 1) % s.length()] << endl;
}</cpp>

We are looking for the character at position $r$ where $r$ is the remainder when $k$ is divided by the length of $s$. Note that since strings are 0-indexed, you must subtract $1$ from $k$ before you take modulo.
