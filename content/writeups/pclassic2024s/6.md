Observe that a stagecoach will only join a cluster if the stagecoach infront has a strictly slower speed. Once it joins the cluster, its velocity will inherit the slower stagecoach's. Note that the x-positions of the stagecoaches does not actually matter because with infinite amount of time, a faster stagecoach behind a slower stagecoach will always catch up. Let's generalize this to all stagecoaches.

If there is a series of $k$ stagecoaches with velocities $v_{1}, v_{2}, ...v_{k}$ â€‹ such that $v_{k} < min(v_{1}, v_{2}, ...v_{k-1})$, then the $k$ stagecoaches will form a cluster moving at velocity $v_{k}$. With infinite amount of time, with each cluster $k$ should be as big as possible. Since only the velocity of the last stagecoach matter, this prompts us to loop backwards - from the rightmost stagecoach to the left.

We can track a global minimum velocity ${v_{min}}$. In our loop, if we encounter a stagecoach with velocity less than ${v_{min}}$, then that stagecoach must form a separate cluster. Thus, we can solve this problem in $O(n)$ time.
