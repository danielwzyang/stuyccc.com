Let's denote the answer to be $c$. From the samples, you could probably see that since you could leave a length $c$ gap at the start, n n could actually be shortened by $c$, assuming we are to place a D on the first slot. So, we want to solve for the maximum $c$ such that $\frac{(n-c)}{c} \ge x$. 

Rearranging the equation we will arrive at $\frac{(n)}{x+1} \ge c$. Since $c$ can be at most $\frac{(n)}{x+1}$, that is our answer.
