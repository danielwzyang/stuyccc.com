Essentially, the problem gives you a list of numbers, and wants you to find the minimum amount of total change done to these numbers to make them all the same number. Thus, you have to pick a number to make them all become.

Crucially, it can be shown that this number is the median of all the numbers. (For any 2 numbers, any number between them will create the same amount of change. Extending this pattern to more numbers makes it clear the median is the optimal choice).

Thus, we loop through the numbers and store them in an array, and then we find the median. Then, we loop through the array and find the differences to the median. The sum of these differences is our result.
